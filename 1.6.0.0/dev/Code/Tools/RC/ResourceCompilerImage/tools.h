// FUNCTION: CenterWindow (HWND, HWND)
// PURPOSE:  Center one window over another
// COMMENTS:
//      Dialog boxes take on the screen position that they were designed at,
//      which is not always appropriate. Centering the dialog over a particular
//      window usually results in a better position.

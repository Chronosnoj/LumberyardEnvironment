// Description : Memory management functions used by CryMemoryManager
//               it looks for them first in the executable, then in CrySystem.dll

// TEMPORARY FIX - define this macro to allow app to be built without using VS2005 SP1 CRT libraries - we
// want to continue using the pre-SP1 libraries (at least for now), since non-programmers don't have the new
// libraries as yet.
